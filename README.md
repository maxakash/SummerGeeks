The project is created using Ionic Framework . I choose this platform becuase with Ionic we can create Android,iOS and PWA using the same code which saves a lot of work.

The data is stored is Firebase Firestore.

I have used SMTP to send emails to the host and visitor and a SMS api to send SMS to the host. Please check spam folder for emails.
